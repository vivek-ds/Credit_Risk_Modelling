# Credit_Risk_Modelling
Using various machine learning techniques to predict the probability of default of a lender 

Banks play a crucial role in market economies. They decide who can get finance and on what terms and can make or break investment decisions. For markets and society to function, individuals and companies need access to credit.
Credit scoring algorithms, which estimate the probability of default, are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted. 

Objective : Improve on the state of the art in credit scoring by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.
